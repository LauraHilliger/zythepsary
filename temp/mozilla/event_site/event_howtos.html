        <h3>A critical factor in events is how the proceedings are facilitated.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Facilitation is a challenging and inexact discipline. So much of &quot;good&quot; facilitation involves listening to participants and steering the agenda and individual sessions to meet their needs. </li>
          <li>Facilitating and pacing the overall event is essential to sustaining participant engagement and energy levels. </li>
          <li>Facilitation of individual sessions is a broad topic, but a common thread is an emphasis on keeping the dialog accessible to all and driving towards the outcomes participants in each session have called out. </li>
          <li>All facilitation is learning exercise in itself, and evaluation is an essential component of any sustainable facilitation model. </li>

        <h3>Importance</h3>
        <p>You should capture what makes your event unique and tell that story. You should strive to collect some standard information across all your events, and share this information with the Mozilla community. This will help us learn how we are doing, whether we are growing, what’s working, and what needs to change.
        <p>
          <strong>Blog posts</strong> are a great way to capture the essence of your event in a story format that would interest people learning about Webmaking. You can aggregate pieces of documentation (such as notes, pictures, video, other blog posts, etc.) and evolve your community through online engagement.</p>

      <h2> Create Talking Points</h2>
      <p>You and your core planning team will want to speak publicly about the event. It is important to communicate your message using consistent language. <strong>Craft 5-10 sentences or ideas that help you to explain the focus, structure and goals of your event.</strong> Here are some sample talking points to use [link] — feel free to borrow or put in your own words. Once you have your 5 - 10 talking points, share them with your peers and get feedback.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="blue">
      <div class="blue">
        <h2> Leverage Social Media </h2>
        <ul class="subCheck">
          <li>
            <h3> Set up a Site</h3>
            <p>You will share your planning process and ideas widely. Create a page for your event. You can use wordpress.com, blogger.com, tumblr.com to create a free page.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3> Get Creative</h3>
            <p>Show the world what you are up to with consistent posts to social media sites including: Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube/ Vimeo  and blogs. Get creative and make your own buzz in these spaces.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3> Define a Hashtag</h3>
            <p>Create a hashtag for the event. Throughout the event  have the constituents  and your staff tweet and post on social networks.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white">
      <h2> Craft a News Release</h2>
      <p><strong>A news release is usually a one-page document describing your event</strong>, your organization and anything noteworthy that you might want to    communicate. This document should be carefully written as reporters will refer to it when writing their stories. Be sure to include links to websites and other resources connected to your event. Finally, remember to <strong>include clear contact information</strong> so that members of the media know who to follow up with.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="blue">
      <div class="blue">
        <h2> Beef Up Your Contacts</h2>
        <p>Send out the news release at least a week before the event. Notify <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mozilla">Mozilla</a> as well as mainstream media outlets in your  community —  newspapers, TV and radio — think about other outlets and  organizations  that potentially could spread the word about your hackjam.  This might  be parent groups, techie meet-ups, bloggers, podcasters, tweeters, etc.  If any these contacts follow up with you, remember to be  honest. <strong>Relying on your talking points will help guide you through the conversation</strong> or email. To be ready for the sorts of questions they’ll likely ask, see our list of Frequently Asked Questions. Show your teams efforts, copy and paste at least three tweets, blogposts or articles that you, your team, or the public wrote about your event. </p>

<h2>Space</h2>
<div class="white">
  <h3>Renting/Borrowing Your Event Space</h3>
  <p>Ideally, the meeting space offers both a large room where the group can meet as a whole, as well as &quot;break-out&quot; spaces, where smaller sets of participants can have discussions and collaborate. <strong>In particular, an optimal venue for a participatory event has:</strong>
  
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Capacity</strong> to seat all participants in a circle in the main meeting area</li>
    <li>Ideally 1 <strong>breakout space/room</strong> per 15 participants&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Wireless <strong>internet</strong>, or an ethernet jack where a wireless router can be connected.</li>
    <li>No fixed-in-place <strong>furniture</strong>; collaborative events go better when participants face each other without any furniture between them</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Other considerations include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Cost</strong>: If you're lucky, you can find a free or cheap place.</li>
    <li> <strong>Catering</strong>: All that cognitive collaborative work making will make people hungry!</li>
    <li>Confirm <strong>hours of access</strong>, and verify that you can be in 1 hour before event start time and stay up to 1 hour after event closing time</li>
    <li>Ask about any <strong>potential conflicts</strong> within the space. If other people/orgs will be using space and overhearing proceedings, make sure to explore potential noise and resource conflicts (e.g. limited bathrooms or a slow internet connection for the facility)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</div>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<div class="white">
<h3>Computers</h3>
<p>You'll most likely need some computers for your event (though it does depend on your theme and learning objectives - you can have a tech event without hardware ;)</p>
<p> Computers and internet access are not essential to successful events, and in fact may prove counterproductive. While machines provide venues for demonstration and sharing, they also create a major distraction from dialog and pure human interaction.</p>
<p> A format that avoids computer use in the early phases of the day but allows for hands-on learning and exploration later in the day arguably offers the best of both worlds; participants start conversations, make new friends and learn about each other's work before diving into the hands-on sharing and learning.</p>
<p> It is essential to let both facilitators and participants know what to expect in these regards.</p>
<ul>

<li> <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/Festival2011-wifiports" target="_blank">Wifi port checklist from the Mozilla community</a></li></ul>
</p>
<h3>Projectors</h3>
<p>It is recommended that when computers are available, at least one projector also be available for group viewing of demonstrations.</p>
</div>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<div class="white">
  <p>At a bare minimum, name tags are an essential mechanism for participants to get to know one another. Two suggestions:
  <p>Consider using a specific name tag format that has high impact: for pre-printed name tags, use only the first name, make it large on the name tag, then print the organizational affiliation in smaller type below it. This immediately makes things more human, giving participants a highly visible handle to use in introducing themselves to friends they have not yet met.
  <p> Don't make different style name tags for participants and facilitators; a single name tag style without role labels breaks down barriers and enhances community energy.    
  <p>In addition, packets containing Participant Guidelines, agenda information, and feedback forms are an excellent resource when budget permits. Notepads and pens are also useful, though many participants tend to bring their own.   
<p> <strong>For group sessions and other brainstorming collaboration, the following are strongly recommended:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>&quot;Post-it&quot; notes, in multiple colors and sizes</li>
    <li>Flip-chart pads, with &quot;Post-it&quot; sticky backing if the budget permits</li>
    <li>Colored markers and pens</li>
    <li>Easels with clips to hold up flip-charts</li>
    <li>Masking tape</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</div>
<h2>IT</h2>
<div class="white">
  <h3> Know Who Your Tech Contact is</h3>
  <p>There's likely someone at the meeting space that takes care of that building/office/restaurant's wifi/Internet. Find out who that person is, and talk to them about your event. Make sure that the space will have a stable enough Internet connection for the number of participants expected. If you have to set up your own wifi and/or power, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/1346886">this awesome checklist</a> from David Wolever. </p>
</div>
<div id="blue">
  <div class="blue">
    <h3>Providing Hardware</h3>
    <p>Have laptops or PCs available for participants or teams of participants. If you don't have the means to provide hardware, make sure participants know to bring their own! If you do have a space with computers, install the most up-to-date version of Firefox, Chrome or Safari
      on the computers.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="white">
  <h3>Install Bookmarklets</h3>
  <p>If you're using Hackasaurus curriculum, check that the Goggles bookmarklet can be installed and works
    in your setup. If possible, pre-install the bookmarklet on all the computers to save time during the event.</p>
</div>
<div id="blue">
  <div class="blue">
    <h3>Projector</h3>
    <p>Set up a projector to a computer so that you can demo things on a screen that everyone can see and participants can share their work.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="white">
  <h3>USB Backups (to deal with firewalls)</h3>
  <p>You can run Firefox and the Hackasaurus Goggles off of a USB stick too: <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" target="_blank">http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable</a> Check that this works on the computers though, as some places have firewalls that restrict the use of external devices.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="blue">Funding</h2>
<div class="white">
  <p>The best  webmaker events keep costs low by focusing on the essentials  and tapping free and cheap resources. But it's still best to assess what  it's going to cost to pull off your event. </p>

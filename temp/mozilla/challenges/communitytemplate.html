            <p>The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.p2pu.org">P2PU</a> have collaborated in creating a series of challenges to teach learning objectives defined by the Hackasaurus project. </p>
            <p> You're receiving this invitation because your organization has proven to be interested in acccessible and social digital literacy learning. For the first phase of the launch on January 16th, we're asking for your help. We would greatly appreciate it if your community members would work through the Mozilla<a href="http://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/" target="_blank"> Hackasaurus Challenges</a> on P2PU. </p>
            <p> Not only will participating community members learn how to remix and shape the Web, they'll do so using new curriculum designed to be fun, engaging, social, and participatory. Plus, if you haven't yet heard about Peer to Peer University, you'll get to know the grassroots open education project that organizes learning outside of  institutional walls and gives learners recognition for their  achievements.</p>
            <p> Just have them go to <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/" target="_blank">http://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/</a>, create an account, and start the challenges. Afterwards, have each community member fill out <a href="survey.html">this survey</a> giving us their feedback. </p>

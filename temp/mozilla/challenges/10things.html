    	<h2>A good challenge has a simple setup to teach a complex problem.</h2>
        <p>Ask yourself: What do I want to teach? How can that be broken up into identifiable and clear goals? Having clear goals for the learner is important to give learners a clear set of expectations of what they need to accomplish by the end of the challenge. When learners take on a role (ie an identity or a multiple set of identities such as  programmer, collaborator … HTML viking), they become committed to the space and the community in which the complex learning challenge is situated.</p>

    	<h2>A good challenge gives the learner a reason to complete the challenge.</h2>
        <p>The &quot;need to know&quot; can be tied to personal motivations such as creating a portfolio site to find a job or social motivations such as leveling up, winning a community-wide competition. A fun factor like a compelling story that draws you into having a reason to solve the challenge is also a &quot;need to know&quot;.</p>

    	<h2>A good challenge has embedded assessment.</h2>
        <p>Embedded assessment helps learners know how they are doing all along the way.</p>

    	<h2>A good challenge unlocks smartools.</h2>
        <p>Smartools something a learner can use again and again in other challenges. For example, Firebug is a type of smartool.  In unlocking these tools learners connect the skills they have gained to actual tools they can use and master.</p>

    	<h2>A good challenge has meaningful achievements.</h2>
        <p>Badges and achievements are connected to the challenge, what the learners do, and the identity they take upon. Achievements provide opportunities for learners to reflect on their own learning and discover new learning pathways with their peers.</p>

   	   <h2>A good challenge has balanced scaffolding.</h2>
        <p>Scaffolding can help one overcome difficulties in a challenge that if too difficult could prevent them from moving forward and if too easy could prevent them from actually learning. This emotional and intellectual state is called “flow” (learn more by watching <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html" target="_blank">Mihaly Csikszentimihalyi’s TedTalk</a>), and it’s common in games when the first levels of a game are very easy but after a certain point the game becomes extremely hard to beat.</p>

    	<h2>A good challenge encourages learners to take risks, explore, and try new things.</h2>
        <p>By tinkering learners feel safe. They’ll try new things and fail multiple times before mastering a skill.</p>

    	<h2>A good challenge gives learners a control over what they are learning.</h2>
        <p>Allowing guru level learners to edit some challenges and remix them or having a requirement to create your own challenge after obtaining high ranked badges, would be such an example. By being on the “driver seat” learners get personally invested in their learning.</p>

    	<h2>A good challenge has many solutions to the same problem.</h2>
        <p>Different users can solve the same problem in different ways.

    	<h2>A good challenge is *so* enjoyable that users will &quot;re-play&quot;.</h2>
        <p>Users will want to replay certain challenges that lead to different outcomes or allow them to level up in the community.</p>

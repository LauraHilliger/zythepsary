<!--    


Welcome to Stuck in the 90's. The Web was much younger back then. We all have some embarrassing thing in our past, and for the Web it was the design. In the 90s websites were boxy and ugly - kind of like this page! In this Mission, you'll change the CSS and HTML of this page to make it pretty! Keep your eye on the comments, they'll give you tips on how to make this page pretty. Once you get the hang of changing the CSS and HTML, make this page your own. Change the content, the colors, the layout!

Change whatever you like, you have complete control!

    <h1>Ahhh the 90's, awesome decade.</h1>
    <h2>Except back then, the Web wasn't very pretty.</h2>
    <h3>Everyone was using tables and websites were so boxy. People used a bunch of different fonts. There was flannel everywhere.</h3>
    <p>Please help this page come out of the 90's. Make it pretty, make it yours! Let's put the past behind us and wash our hair on a regular basis. Grunge is so over!</p>

        	<h3>Origin</h3><div><p><img src="images/construct.png" alt="Suprematism and Constructivism" vspace="3"/>While the <a class="zem_slink" title="Dada" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada">Dadaists</a> were busy being pessimistic and cynical due to the historical situation of the time, other avant-garde artists were using art as a method to create change towards Utopian ideals. After the Russian Revolution, Russian artists absorbed Cubism and Futurism to coin a term called <a title="Cubo-Futurism" href="http://www.bigfunarts.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=86:a-series-of-isms&catid=61:a-series-of-isms&Itemid=82">Cubo-Futurism</a>.</p><p> A short time later, <a class="zem_slink" title="Kazimir Malevich" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimir_Malevich">Kazimir Malevich</a>, a Russian avant-garde, was the pioneer of <a class="zem_slink" title="Geometric abstraction" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_abstraction">geometric abstract art</a>. He used abstraction, and non-objective geometric patterns in a style and artistic movement he called <a class="zem_slink" title="Suprematism" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprematism">Suprematism</a>. Suprematism is not about a feeling, but of a sensation. </p><p><a class="zem_slink" title="Constructivism (art)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_%28art%29">Constructivism</a> emerged when a series of artists rejected the idea of &quot;art for art's sake&quot; and began devoting themselves to the practical arts of industrial design and other visual communications. Constructivism called on artists to stop producing useless things and to use art for industry and social causes. It had three main principles: tectonics, texture, and construction. Happening during the time of the Russian Revolution, Constuctivism called for order and organization to be restored.

                <h3>Period</h3>
                <div><p>1917 to 1922 in Russia</p></div>
                
                 <h3>Aesthetic Characteristics</h3>
                <div><p>Suprematism uses elemental shapes and color to create form. These concrete elements constructed together created expressive qualities arising not from a pictorial image but from pure content and arrangement. Abstraction became based on sensation and this movement is abstract. This is abstract. Reductive simplicity, moving towards complete abstraction. </p>
                <p>
Constructivism took the abstraction of Supremacism one step further and created an, as Lissitzky said “interchange station between painting and architecture.” Supremacist design elements were transformed into political statements through choice of color and three dimensional illusions that receded and preceded the picture plane.</p></div>

                		<h4>Kazimir Malevich</h4>
                    	<p><a title='Kazimir Malevich [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons' href='http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kazimir_Malevich_-_'Suprematist_Composition',_1916.jpg'><img width='192' alt='Kazimir Malevich - &#039;Suprematist Composition&#039;, 1916' src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Kazimir_Malevich_-_%27Suprematist_Composition%27%2C_1916.jpg/240px-Kazimir_Malevich_-_%27Suprematist_Composition%27%2C_1916.jpg'/></a> <em>Supremacist Compositions</em> Here abstraction is based on the reductive simplicity, moving towards complete abstraction creating a sense of sensation. He use entirely non representation art forms (squares) and space, with radical visionary values. There is an absolute rejection of materialism and the objective world. Malevich abstract art replaced the familiar world of naturalism, everyday objects, and events, to form an aesthetic blueprint for a utopian world and for superior forms of personal expression, evoking a sense of sublime boundlessness. Here he goes deeper until he comes to pure emptiness, pure being.  His interest is in spirituality.</p>

                        <h4>El Lissitsky</h4>
                    	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Artwork_by_El_Lissitzky_1919.jpg"><img title="&quot;Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge&quot;..." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Artwork_by_El_Lissitzky_1919.jpg/300px-Artwork_by_El_Lissitzky_1919.jpg" alt="&quot;Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge&quot;..." width='192' /></a><em>Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge</em> The political piece shows the red wedge (a symbol of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Bolshevik" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> Army) slashing through the &quot;white&quot; forces that were in power. The text dynamically floats around the image, reinforcing movement of the cause. A student of Malevich, Lissitsky was perhaps the most prolific Constructivist. His work transformed Supremacism into the political statements <a class="zem_slink" title="Constructivism (art)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_%28art%29">Constructivism</a> became known for. He believed that the <a class="zem_slink" title="Russian Revolution (1917)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_%281917%29">Russian Revolution</a> would create a new world order in which technology, art, social engineering and communism would provide for society and its needs.</p>

                        <h4>Aleksandr Rodchencko</h4>

Space is as important as elements in a constructivist work. The piece was created out of a single piece of plywood, transforming a single plane into a three dimensional object representative of orbits. Rodchencko was interested in lines writing in 1921 <blockquote>&quot;in the line a new worldview became clear: to build in essence, and not depict (objectify or non-objectify); build new, expedient, constructive structures in life, and not from life and outside of life.&quot;</blockquote></p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <div><p>By 1922 the political situation and tolerance became hostile and overtook the artists abilities to work an the advancement of the styles. Both styles had, however, a lasting effect in the art world, particularly in graphic design.</p></div>
